<br>
<br>
<br>
Potential employees (Job Seekers) should be able to visit the Daytona.io website, easily locate the Careers Page (https://www.daytona.io/company/careers), locate the vacancy or opporunity they are interested in and be able to apply in a just a few easy and clear steps.
<br>
<br>
The application 'input form' should be concise and quick to complete - but importantly allow input of ALL valuable and useful information. 
<br>
<br>
Once the application is submitted, the applicant should receive a notification to confirm and a colleague from our HR/Recruit Team should also receive this and be able to commence review. 
The project was started in Code Academy, learning the basics and deeper use of CSS and HTML.  We also investigated the use of API connections.
